### About
I am a passionate Backend Software Engineer with a strong foundation in full-stack development, particularly in Ruby on Rails. 
Currently working as a Software Engineering Contractor at Ownify, I specialize in building innovative applications for the homeownership sector. 
My experience includes integrating payment systems, implementing API workflows, and developing user-friendly tools with a focus on localization.

Prior to my transition into tech, I served as an Operations Manager at Nabors Drilling Technologies, where I successfully managed large teams and significant capital resources, driving a 30% increase in operational efficiency. 
This unique blend of technical and managerial experience allows me to approach challenges with a holistic perspective.

I thrive in collaborative environments and enjoy mentoring others, fostering growth and learning within teams. 
My technical skills include Ruby on Rails, PostgreSQL, Redis, and CI/CD processes, complemented by a solid understanding of Agile workflows and Test-Driven Development. 
I am committed to delivering high-quality software solutions and continuously expanding my knowledge in the ever-evolving tech landscape.
